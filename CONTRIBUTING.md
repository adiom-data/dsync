# Contributing to Dsync

## Asking questions or requesting help

Join the [Dsync Developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/adiom.io/g/dsync-dev) for general questions, deeper
technical discussions and to discuss your ideas for contributions.

## Reporting an issue

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/adiom-data/dsync/issues) to report issues or to suggest features. Fill
in as much information as you can in the issue template, especially for performance problems.

## Contributing code to Dsync

Before you can contribute code to Dsync for the first time, you should sign
the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.jotform.com/sign/241826252685058/invite/01j1r2zqvc7a7aff403461f1ef). You
can then submit your changes as a pull request to the [Dsync project on github](https://github.com/adiom-data/dsync).

Note that we use a 'Stable Main' workflow:

* Use feature branch with Pull Request for new work
* Resolve all merge conflicts before submitting branch
* Only fast forward pull requests accepted
* PR should pass all the tests
* Use Meaningful Commit Messages!

## Documentation for developers

You can find guidelines and internal documentation for developers in
the [docs-dev](https://github.com/adiom-data/dsync/tree/main/docs-dev) folder.
