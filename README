Principles:

* Isolation and abstraction
Entities only use interfaces of others. Imagine implementations distributed as separate packages
* Remote readiness
Assume that components can run remotely - don't exchange pointers or references to locally allocated objects
* Async-first
Anything that may possibly block should be executed asynchronously - no inline blocking calls
